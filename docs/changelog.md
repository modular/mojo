# Mojo unreleased changelog

This is a list of UNRELEASED changes for the Mojo language and tools.

When we cut a release, these notes move to `changelog-released.md` and that's
what we publish.

## UNRELEASED

### ‚ú® Highlights

### Language changes

### Standard library changes

### Tooling changes

- mblack (aka `mojo format`) no longer formats non-mojo files. This prevents
  unexpected formatting of python files.

- Full struct signature information is now exposed in the documentation
  generator, and in the symbol outline and hover markdown via the Mojo Language
  Server.

### ‚ùå Removed

### üõ†Ô∏è Fixed

- The Mojo Kernel for Jupyter Notebooks is working again on nightly releases.

- The command `mojo debug --vscode` now sets the current working directory
  properly.

- The Mojo Language Server doesn't crash anymore on empty **init**.mojo files.
