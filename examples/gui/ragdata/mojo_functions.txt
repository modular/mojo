# Mojo Functions

Mojo functions can be declared with either fn or def.

The fn declaration enforces type-checking and memory-safe behaviors (Rust style), while def allows no type declarations and dynamic behaviors (Python style).

For example, this def function doesn't require declaration of argument types or the return type:

```mojo
def greet(name):
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

While the same thing as an fn function requires that you specify the argument type and the return type like this:

```mojo
fn greet2(name: String) -> String:
    return "Hello, " + name + "!"
```

Both functions have the same result, but the fn function provides compile-time checks to ensure the function receives and returns the correct types. Whereas, the def function might fail at runtime if it receives the wrong type.

Currently, Mojo doesn't support top-level code in a .mojo (or .ðŸ”¥) file, so every program must include a function named main() as the entry point. You can declare it with either def or fn:

```mojo
def main():
   print("Hello, world!")
```
